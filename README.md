Welcome to the **Airport Traffic Controller** App! ðŸ˜Š

This wonderful application is designed to efficiently manage and control the flow of flights at airports or fighter aircraft at air bases. Its primary purpose is to ensure smooth and organized operations by providing comprehensive control over the movement and coordination of planes within the designated airspace and under uncertain weather conditions.

## Getting Started 

### To install and run Airport Traffic App locally, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine:

      cd my-airTrafficController-app
3. Install the dependencies using npm:

## Usage
---------

1. Start the application by running the following command. This command will start the execution of the application using the airTrafficController.js file as the entry point.
      ```bash
      npm airTrafficController.js
2. Interact with the application by customizing the following airport and flights features:

* **Airport Status**: The airport status section displays real-time information about the airport, including its name, capacity, weather, and flights currently at the airport.

      This APP adhere the following **Airport operation rules**:
```
      1. No plane can land if the airport is at full capacity to ensure available space before allowing any incoming planes to land.
      2. A plane should be at the airport before being granted permission for take-off.
      3. A plane that is already at the airport cannot land again to prevent duplicate landing requests.
      4. No plane can land or take off during stormy weather conditions.
      5. Once a plane successfully takes off, it is considered to have left the airport.
      6. Once a plane lands, it must remain at the airport until its next scheduled take-off.
```

4. Utilize the **Reports and Analytics** section to generate reports on flight statistics and analyze airport performance. This helps to provide data-driven decisions and improve airport operations.
